Hello so for this project to work you need 3 terminals to run it. 
Step1: on one terminal run part2.click 
Step2: open another terminal and run part1.click ( this is part 1 of the assignment) on the terminal with part 2 you should see that it worked. 
Step3: open another terminal and run part3.click after this go back to the terminal for part 1.click and run that again. 
Step4: go back to the terminal where you ran part3.click and you should see that the packet was returned/ acknowledge( part 2 of the assignment)
